BAM!  A mug of ale hits the table, splashing your shoes.  Muddy Charlie slumps back in his chair, eyes you carefully, and starts to chuckle.

"You know your problem?  You don't think big enough."

His expression is familiar.  Last time you saw that look, it was just before you two decided to rustle the mayor's private herd back in 1866.  That didn't work so well.

"What now?" you ask.  "A new idea?"

"Big plans."  He grins widely.  "That new cross-country railroad is almost finished.  It's gonna change everything... bigger trains, more people... and prize cargo."

"A train holdup?  Are you kidding?"

"Relax.  This time we got technology on our side."  He leans close and whispers:  "Made in Sweden... or Germany.  It's big, dangerous, and nobody knows about it yet."

"A new weapon?"

"Dynamic, buddy.  Dynamic Might."

Dirt Road
Muddy wasn't particularly clear in his instructions, but you're pretty sure this is the trail he wanted you to follow this morning.  Now that your horse has inexplicably bolted, you can use all the luck you can get.

This is a dusty trail that wanders off east and west for miles.  The sun blasts down on the back of your neck, but you can smell the cool tang of some pine trees off to the north.  You also spy the lower slopes of a small mountain that way.

>[Nice prologue.]
That's not a verb I recognise.

>n
You shamble slowly toward the trees.

Copse
At last, some shade!

You're in a section of dense pine forest at the base of a small mountain.  There are cones and needles littered about, and the treetops chatter with birdsong.  The slope continues up the mountain, or back down towards the road.

You can see a pine cone here.

>take all
pine cone: Taken.

Grassy Plateau
The land opens up into a large green space here, partway up the mountain. The grasses are nearly five feet high, full of life.  

This is a wide field of untamed prairie.  To the east, a mountain rises up towards its summit, while another hill is faintly visible to the west.  You also can make out a faint trail leading northeast through the brush.

A vulture circles omniously overhead.

A chipmunk scurries about.

The chipmunk looks at your possessions and freezes in place for a moment.  It bolts away, speeding west.

>ne

Bluff
You're standing on a wide bluff about fifty feet up a small mountain, overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill.  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.  

>x track
The track extends off into the distance, then curves out of sight around a far-off hill. 

>x tunnel
The tunnel runs straight through the mountain, directly below the bluff.  It looks a bit unstable as well, with bits of dirt crumbling into it.  You see a long stick hanging out of the top of the tunnel's arch, probably some remnant of a broken branch.

>x stick
It's a thin stick, about two feet long.

Chasm
You press through the grasses, squinting at the bright sky, then suddenly lose your footing.  You scramble to regain your balance and realize you nearly walked off a cliff.

The edge of the plateau stops abruptly at a chasm that drops nearly one hundred feet.  Luckily, there's a flimsy-looking rope bridge that spans the gap.  It stretches westward to another isolated bluff.  To the east, the grasses look more inviting.

A vulture circles omniously overhead.

A chipmunk scurries about.

The chipmunk spins around, looks at something you're carrying, then panics.  It bolts away, speeding west.

Lone Tree Bluff
This is a very small bluff, almost an island in a sea of open air.  A gigantic oak tree dominates the space; it's an eruption of countless branches and thick bushy leaves.

Looks like someone left a rusty old bucket here.

Summit
You wander east, and slowly climb up the mountain.

Here at the top the mountain, the wind blows strong and carries the smell of endless summer.  There are no trees up here, no tall grass, but bits of shrubbery dot the area.  The view is remarkable, though;  you can see grassy hills for miles around.  A train track clearly extends north into the distance, running away from this mountain.

It's an ordinary shrub.  Or... wait, is that a piece of string tied to its base?

As you untie the string from the shrub, you feel a gentle snap on the other end.  The string then slips from your grip and slides off the cliff.

>undo

[Previous turn undone.]

>x string
The string is tied to the base of the shrub, and seems to run along the ground behind the shrub.   It then dips down out of sight off a cliff at the eastern part the summit.

>e
You can't go that way.

>e

>x cliff
It's a stark drop at the eastern edge of the summit.  Looking over the cliff, you see a small wooden box sitting on an outcropping about five feet below.  There's a string tied to the box, leading up to a shrub.

>[See, that was a wild guess.  I sort of wish that >X STRING made you find that box.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>get box
There's no way you can reach down to the box, it's at least a couple of feet out of reach.  Maybe if you had some way to reach it?

It's a rusty wind-up timepiece, handed down from your uncle.  It currently reads 9:02 am.

>read paper
The paper contains scribblings from the Little Snoring train station, about twenty miles down the trail.  The train only comes through town once per day, and by your partner's calculations, it should be speeding by this area around 10:30am.  Angry smeared handwriting screams "MOUNTAIN, DYNAMIC MIGHT ETHZF... TRAIN TUNNEL ^$*@ DON'T BELLATE."

You lean down off the cliff and delicately balance the edge of the box on your stick, carefully bringing it up to you.

Taken.

>[Hm.  Take box with stick, if that's in fact what I end up doing, should work.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x box
It's a small wooden box, with the words "Warning:  Handle Carefully" stamped on it.

>open box
You open the box, revealing a stick bundle and a sparker tool.

>[oh my]
That's not a verb I recognise.

>x tool
This thing seems familiar;  it looks like a spring-loaded pair of scissors with a small plate at one end.  If you apply a pound or two of pressure to the plate, the device slowly clamps together into a long stick.  When you push the plate quickly, rapid friction on the opposite tip can produce sparks.  It's good for starting campfires or lighting stoves.

You suppose putting stuff on top of the sparker can make it spark too, provided it's heavy enough.  Hm...

The smell of hyacinth wafts in the air.

>x hyacinth
You can't see any such thing.

>smell hyacinth

>listen
You hear nothing unexpected.

>smell

>x bundle
You've never seen anything like this before.  It looks like a collection of cylinders, each wrapped in plain brown paper.  The side of each stick reads "Nobel's Blasting Powder, U.S. Patent 78317."   You don't see any sort of obvious fuse coming out of the sticks, however... just an empty space at the top of each cylinder, big enough to put your finger into.

It currently contains nothing.

A brief breeze flaps your clothing.

If that weren't enough, you hear a low rumble, and suddenly the ground begins to crack and crumble.  The earth opens up, and the entire front of the bluff violently collapses downward, filling the tunnel below!

High above, a vulture glides into the area.

The train is moving down the track, getting closer.

The train is approaching the tunnel!

Time passes.

You hear some crickets chirp nearby.

Seeing the collapsed tunnel, the train engineer yells and slams the brakes!  The giant machine shrieks;  steam and sparks pour from the engine, and the train comes to a stop just inches before the tunnel debris.  You can hear all sorts of panic and screams coming from the train.

In fact, that looks like Muddy himself leaning out of the train window!  He's wildly gesticulating at you.  Is that a a thumbs-up signal he's giving you?

You can't see any such thing.

Bluff (in the circle of rocks)
You're standing on the edge of a dangerous, collapsed bluff overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill. (Of course, the tunnel is now completely full of rocks and dirt.)  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.  

>d
You'd surely fall to your death!

>sw
You'll have to get out of the circle of rocks first.

You feel a tap on your back, and you spin around.

Three guns are pointed in your face.

"We know all about your plan", one of Marshalls states coldly.  "We've been tracking you and Muddy for days.  Keep your hands in the air, and follow us."

You can see that Muddy is here, also held at gunpoint and already handcuffed.  You pause for a moment, consider your options, then decide that death is perhaps worse than being locked in a cell with an angry Muddy.

"Don't worry", Muddy whispers.  "I have a plan..."

    *** You have won ***



Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT?
