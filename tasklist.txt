GENERAL THINGS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT
====================================

  * First-order nouns need to be fleshed out EVERYWHERE.

      Players expect to be at least able to examine everything
      mentioned in prose, and perhaps even interact with it.

  * Sounds and smells are needed EVERYWHERE.

      At least invisible create regions of sound/smell.

  * Red herrings are proving cruel.

      Players get really frustrated with bucket and pine cone.  Either
      they should be removed, hinted that they're distractions, or
      make them marginally useful (perhaps as alternate solutions to
      puzzles.)

  * Sloppiness in implementing different aspects of main puzzle:

     1. Confusion about squirrel.

         People want to be able to interact with it more.  Need more
         hints about its desire/fears.  Clarify role of hat.

     2. Confusion about fetching the box.

         Can people figure out how to reach it?

     3. Confusion about how to use sparker.

         Make it clearer that fuse is really gone, and that sparker
         should take its place.  Make it clear that sparker requires
         pressure to move.

     3. Confusion about rock-circle.

         It's relation to the bluff isn't clear -- where is it?  Do
         people realize it protects?

  * Need scoring system.

      Give players positive feedback when they accomplish things,
      rather than confusing aimlessness.

  * Need real help system.

       Let players ask for progressive hints.

  * Warn users about making game unwinnable.

       Shooting the squirrel.  Throwing things into chasm. Missing the
       train.  Blowing up dynamite prematurely.  Running out of
       bullets when shooting the branch.




REPORTED BUGS
=============

* gun shoots without bullets

* chipmunk:

     - can't see acorn unless you place it on *grounded* bundle.
     - doesn't do anything when left alone with acorn
     - if dead, understand 'chipmunk' as the chipmunk corpse.

* box is openable without taking it first

* after the explosion, looking in tunnel shouldn't be 'empty'.

* rock formation:

     - description should change when inside them
     - make it clear that it's protected / far from tunnel
     - when objects are inside it, clarify their protection?

* 'tunnel-arch' is a valid noun?  really? ('put bundle in tunnel-arch')

* buggy explosion sequence:  build whole contraption with acorn, pick
  it up, carry it into rocks, drop it.  BOOM, yet you're not dead!

* explosion should loop over *all* animate object that can see it, so
  more than one creature can die (2 animals + player)



REQUESTED ENHANCEMENTS
======================

* hat should only allow objects to enter it when it's not being worn.

* get rid of string altogether -- just mention it falling away when
  the box is fetched.

* things should be droppable/throwable into chasm, including self

* understand 'kick chipmunk' as 'hit chipmunk'

* make chipmunk catchable?  pettable?  releaseable?

* bucket should be wearable

* sparker should be able to BURN certain things!

* alternate puzzle solution:  put chipmunk corpse on sparker, vulture
  swoops down to set it off.  (vulture should swoop on corpses in
  general)

* 'kick bucket' should say something.

* make dynamite explodable in other ways:  hit/shoot bundle, shoot
  box, pushing sparker directly or with stick.
