BAM!  A mug of ale hits the table, splashing your shoes.  Muddy Charlie slumps back in his chair, eyes you carefully, and starts to chuckle.

&quot;You know your problem?  You don&apos;t think big enough.&quot;

His expression is familiar.  Last time you saw that look, it was just before you two decided to hijack the mayor&apos;s private herd back in 1866.  That didn&apos;t work so well.

&quot;What now?&quot; you ask.  &quot;A new idea?&quot;

&quot;Big plans.&quot;  He grins widely.  &quot;That new cross-country railroad is almost finished.  It&apos;s gonna change everything... bigger trains, more people... and prize cargo.&quot;

&quot;A train holdup?  Are you kidding?&quot;

&quot;Relax.  This time we got technology on our side.&quot;  He leans close and whispers:  &quot;Made in Sweden... or Germany.  It&apos;s big, dangerous, and nobody knows about it yet.&quot;

&quot;A new weapon?&quot;

&quot;Dynamic, buddy.  Dynamic Might.&quot;

Lone Tree Bluff
This is a very small bluff, almost an island in a sea of open air.  A gigantic oak tree dominates the space; it&apos;s an eruption of countless branches and thick bushy leaves.

Looks like someone left a rusty old bucket here.

Summit
You wander east, and slowly climb up the mountain.

Here at the top the mountain, the wind blows strong and carries the smell of endless summer.  There are no trees up here, no tall grass, but bits of shrubbery dot the area.  The view is remarkable, though;  you can see grassy hills for miles around.  A train track clearly extends north into the distance, and a small bluff is visible further down the north face.

A vulture circles omniously overhead.

You&apos;re in a section of dense pine forest at the base of a small mountain.  There are cones and needles littered about, and the treetops chatter with birdsong.  The slope continues up the mountain, or back down towards the road.

The chipmunk enthusiastically jumps up onto the sparker to grab the acorn!
A fiery flash and earth-shattering boom rocks you!  The shock wave literally knocks you off your feet, as debris explodes in all directions.
The chipmunk screams and is torn apart by the exposion.
If that weren&apos;t enough, you hear a low rumble, and suddenly the ground begins to crack and crumble.  The earth opens up, and entire front of the bluff violently collapses downward, filling the tunnel below!

Bluff
You&apos;re standing on the edge of a dangerous, collapsed bluff overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill. (Of course, the tunnel is now completely full of rocks and dirt.)  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.

You&apos;re standing on the edge of a dangerous, collapsed bluff overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill. (Of course, the tunnel is now completely full of rocks and dirt.)  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.   

A long train is approaching! 

Seeing the collapsed tunnel, the train engineer yells and slams the brakes!  The giant machine shrieks;  steam and sparks pour from the engine, and the train comes to a stop just inches before the tunnel debris.  You can hear all sorts of panic and screams coming from the train.

In fact, that looks like Muddy himself leaning out of the train window!  He&apos;s wildly gesticulating at you.  Is that a a thumbs-up signal he&apos;s giving you?
