BAM!  A mug of ale hits the table, splashing your shoes.  Muddy Charlie slumps back in his chair, eyes you carefully, and starts to chuckle.

&quot;You know your problem?  You don&apos;t think big enough.&quot;

His expression is familiar.  Last time you saw that look, it was just before you two decided to rustle the mayor&apos;s private herd back in 1866.  That didn&apos;t work so well.

&quot;What now?&quot; you ask.  &quot;A new idea?&quot;

&quot;Big plans.&quot;  He grins widely.  &quot;That new cross-country railroad is almost finished.  It&apos;s gonna change everything... bigger trains, more people... and prize cargo.&quot;

&quot;A train holdup?  Are you kidding?&quot;

&quot;Relax.  This time we got technology on our side.&quot;  He leans close and whispers:  &quot;Made in Sweden... or Germany.  It&apos;s big, dangerous, and nobody knows about it yet.&quot;

&quot;A new weapon?&quot;

&quot;Dynamic, buddy.  Dynamic Might.&quot; 

Trainstopping
A wild west debacle by Ben Collins-Sussman
Release 8 / Serial number 080126 / Inform 7 build 5J39 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/11N) SD
(Type HELP if you&apos;re new to interactive fiction.)

Dirt Road
Muddy wasn&apos;t particularly clear in his instructions, but you&apos;re pretty sure this is the trail he wanted you to follow this morning.  Now that your horse has inexplicably bolted, you can use all the luck you can get.

This is a dusty trail that wanders off to the west for miles, and ends here near the base of an unscalable mountain just to your east.  It&apos;s hot out here;  really hot.  The sun blasts down on the back of your neck, but you can smell the cool tang of some pine trees off to the north.  You also spy some inviting lower slopes that way.

The view is remarkable, though;  you can see grassy hills for miles around.  A train track clearly extends north into the distance, and a small bluff is visible further down the north face.

Grassy Plateau
This is a wide field of untamed prairie.  To the east, a mountain rises up towards its summit, while another hill is faintly visible to the west.  You also can make out a faint trail leading northeast through the brush.

A chipmunk scurries about.

The chipmunk spins around, looks at something you&apos;re carrying, then panics.  It bolts away, speeding northeast.

Chasm
You press through the grasses, squinting at the bright sky, then suddenly lose your footing.  You scramble to regain your balance and realize you nearly walked off a cliff.

The edge of the plateau stops abruptly at a chasm that drops nearly one hundred feet.  Luckily, there&apos;s a flimsy-looking rope bridge that spans the gap.  It stretches westward to another isolated bluff.  To the east, the grasses look more inviting.

High above, a vulture glides into the area.

Bluff
You&apos;re standing on a wide bluff about fifty feet up a small mountain, overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill.  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.  

The chipmunk arrives from the southwest.

A fiery flash and earth-shattering boom rocks you!  The shock wave literally knocks you off your feet, as debris explodes in all directions.
The chipmunk screams and is torn apart by the exposion.
If that weren&apos;t enough, you hear a low rumble, and suddenly the ground begins to crack and crumble.  The earth opens up, and the entire front of the bluff violently collapses downward, filling the tunnel below!

Seeing the collapsed tunnel, the train engineer yells and slams the brakes!  The giant machine shrieks;  steam and sparks pour from the engine, and the train comes to a stop just inches before the tunnel debris.  You can hear all sorts of panic and screams coming from the train.

In fact, that looks like Muddy himself leaning out of the train window!  He&apos;s wildly gesticulating at you.  Is that a a thumbs-up signal he&apos;s giving you?

You feel a tap on your back, and you spin around.

Three guns are pointed in your face.

&quot;We know all about your plan&quot;, one of Marshalls states coldly.  &quot;We&apos;ve been tracking you and Muddy for days.  Keep your hands in the air, and follow us.&quot;

You can see that Muddy is here, also held at gunpoint and already handcuffed.  You pause for a moment, consider your options, then decide that death is perhaps worse than being locked in a cell with an angry Muddy.

&quot;Don&apos;t worry&quot;, Muddy whispers.  &quot;I have a plan...&quot;

Grassy Plateau
This is a wide field of untamed prairie.  To the east, a mountain rises up towards its summit, while another hill is faintly visible to the west.  You also can make out a faint trail leading northeast through the brush.

High above, a vulture glides into the area.

The chipmunk arrives from the west.

Bluff
You&apos;re standing on a wide bluff about fifty feet up a small mountain, overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill.  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.  

High above, a vulture glides into the area.

The chipmunk arrives from the southwest.

Summit
You wander east, and slowly climb up the mountain.

Here at the top the mountain, the wind blows strong and carries the smell of endless summer.  There are no trees up here, no tall grass, but bits of shrubbery dot the area.
