BAM!  A mug of ale hits the table, splashing your shoes.  Muddy Charlie slumps back in his chair, eyes you carefully, and starts to chuckle.

&quot;You know your problem?  You don&apos;t think big enough.&quot;

His expression is familiar.  Last time you saw that look, it was just before you two decided to rustle the mayor&apos;s private herd back in 1866.  That didn&apos;t work so well.

&quot;What now?&quot; you ask.  &quot;A new idea?&quot;

&quot;Big plans.&quot;  He grins widely.  &quot;That new cross-country railroad is almost finished.  It&apos;s gonna change everything... bigger trains, more people... and prize cargo.&quot;

&quot;A train holdup?  Are you kidding?&quot;

&quot;Relax.  This time we got technology on our side.&quot;  He leans close and whispers:  &quot;Made in Sweden... or Germany.  It&apos;s big, dangerous, and nobody knows about it yet.&quot;

&quot;A new weapon?&quot;

&quot;Dynamic, buddy.  Dynamic Might.&quot; 

Trainstopping
A wild west debacle by Ben Collins-Sussman
Release 9 / Serial number 080229 / Inform 7 build 5J39 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/11N) SD
(Type HELP if you&apos;re new to interactive fiction.)

Dirt Road
Muddy wasn&apos;t particularly clear in his instructions, but you&apos;re pretty sure this is the trail he wanted you to follow this morning.  Now that your horse has inexplicably bolted, you can use all the luck you can get.

This is a dusty trail that wanders off to the west for miles, and ends here near the base of an unscalable mountain just to your east.  It&apos;s hot out here;  really hot.  The sun blasts down on the back of your neck, but you can smell the cool tang of some pine trees off to the north.  You also spy some inviting lower slopes that way.

Grassy Plateau
The land opens up into a large green space here, partway up the mountain. The grasses are nearly five feet high, full of life.  

This is a wide field of untamed prairie.  To the east, a mountain rises up towards its summit, while another hill is faintly visible to the west.  You also can make out a faint trail leading northeast through the brush.

A chipmunk scurries about.

The chipmunk sniffs around, mostly ignoring you.

Chasm
You press through the grasses, squinting at the bright sky, then suddenly lose your footing.  You scramble to regain your balance and realize you nearly walked off a cliff.

The edge of the plateau stops abruptly at a chasm that drops nearly one hundred feet.  Luckily, there&apos;s a flimsy-looking rope bridge that spans the gap.  It stretches westward to another isolated bluff.  To the east, the grasses look more inviting.

This is a dusty trail that wanders off to the west for miles, and ends here near the base of an unscalable mountain just to your east.  It&apos;s hot out here;  really hot.  The sun blasts down on the back of your neck, but you can smell the cool tang of some pine trees off to the north.  You also spy some inviting lower slopes that way.

The game you are playing is a work of Interactive Fiction.  In interactive fiction you play the main character of a story.  You type commands which determine the actions of the character and the flow of the plot.  Some IF games include graphics, but most do not: the imagery is provided courtesy of your imagination.  On the other hand, there&apos;s a wide range of action available: whereas in other games you may be restricted to shooting, movement, or searching items you can click on with a mouse, IF allows you a wide range of verbs.

The &gt; sign is where the game says, &quot;Okay, what do you want to do now?&quot;  You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.

The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you&apos;re carrying, as well.

Once you&apos;ve gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.

At any given time, you are in a specific location, or room. When you go into a room, the game will print a description of what you can see there. This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the room you can interact with or take, and a list of exits, or ways out. If you want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK. 

When you want to leave a location and go to another one, you may communicate this to the game using compass directions: eg, GO NORTH. For simplicity&apos;s sake, you are allowed to omit the word GO, and to abbreviate the compass directions. So you may use NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, UP, and DOWN, or in short form N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U, and D.

In some locations, IN and OUT will also be useful.

Throughout the game there will be assorted objects that you can do things with. Most importantly, you may TAKE or GET items, and (when you are tired of them) DROP them again. INVENTORY (abbreviated I) will list the items you are currently holding. 

There are usually assorted things you may do with these objects. OPEN, CLOSE, WEAR, EAT, LOCK, and UNLOCK are especially common.

Occasionally, you will find that the game does not recognize the name of an object even though it has been described as being in the room with you. If this is the case, the object is just there for scenery, and you may assume that you do not need to interact with it.

There are a few simple commands for controlling the game itself. These are: 

SAVE saves a snapshot of the game as it is now. 
RESTORE puts the game back to a previous saved state. You may keep as many saved games as you like. 
RESTART puts the game back to the way it was at the beginning. 
QUIT ends the game.

Most IF games are set in a world made up of rooms without internal division. Movement between rooms is possible; movement within a room does not always amount to anything. &gt;WALK OVER TO THE DESK is rarely a useful sort of command. On the other hand, if something is described as being high or out of reach, it is sometimes relevant to stand on an object to increase your height. This kind of activity tends to be important only if prompted by the game text.

One thing that IF does tend to model thoroughly is containment. Is something in or on something else? The game keeps track of this, and many puzzles have to do with where things are -- in the player&apos;s possession, lying on the floor of the room, on a table, in a box, etc.

Most of the actions you can perform in the world of IF are brief and specific. &gt;WALK WEST or &gt;OPEN DOOR are likely to be provided. &gt;TAKE A JOURNEY or &gt;BUILD A TABLE are not. Things like &gt;GO TO THE HOTEL are on the borderline: some games allow them, but most do not. In general, abstract, multi-stage behavior usually has to be broken down in order for the game to understand it.

Other characters in IF games are sometimes rather limited. On the other hand, there are also games in which character interaction is the main point of the game. You should be able to get a feel early on for the characters -- if they seem to respond to a lot of questions, remember what they&apos;re told, move around on their own, etc., then they may be fairly important. If they have a lot of stock responses and don&apos;t seem to have been the game designer&apos;s main concern, then they are most likely present either as local color or to provide the solution to a specific puzzle or set of puzzles. Characters in very puzzle-oriented games often have to be bribed, threatened, or cajoled into doing something that the player cannot do -- giving up a piece of information or an object, reaching something high, allowing the player into a restricted area, and so on.

Rephrase. If there&apos;s something you want to do, but the game doesn&apos;t seem to understand you, try alternative wordings. 

Try variations. Sometimes an action doesn&apos;t work, but does produce some kind of unusual result. These are often indications that you&apos;re on the right track, even if you haven&apos;t figured out quite the right approach yet. Pressing the red button alone may only cause a grinding noise from inside the wall, so perhaps pressing the blue and then the red will open the secret door.

Consider the genre of the game. Mysteries, romances, and thrillers all have their own types of action and motivation. What are you trying to do, and how do conventional characters go about doing that? What&apos;s the right sort of behavior for a detective/romance heroine/spy?

Dirt Road
This is a dusty trail that wanders off to the west for miles, and ends here near the base of an unscalable mountain just to your east.  It&apos;s hot out here;  really hot.  The sun blasts down on the back of your neck, but you can smell the cool tang of some pine trees off to the north.  You also spy some inviting lower slopes that way.

You wander east, and slowly climb up the mountain.

Here at the top the mountain, the wind blows strong and carries the smell of endless summer.  There are no trees up here, no tall grass, but bits of shrubbery dot the area.  The view is remarkable, though;  you can see grassy hills for miles around.  A train track clearly extends north into the distance, and a small bluff is visible further down the north face.

The sun mercilessly continues to bake the land.

You feel a tap on your back, and you spin around.

Three guns are pointed in your face.

&quot;We know all about your plan&quot;, one of Marshalls states coldly.  &quot;We&apos;ve been tracking you and Muddy for days.  Keep your hands in the air, and follow us.&quot;

You can see that Muddy is here, also held at gunpoint and already handcuffed.  You pause for a moment, consider your options, then decide that death is perhaps worse than being locked in a cell with an angry Muddy.

&quot;Don&apos;t worry&quot;, Muddy whispers.  &quot;I have a plan...&quot;

Grassy Plateau
This is a wide field of untamed prairie.  To the east, a mountain rises up towards its summit, while another hill is faintly visible to the west.  You also can make out a faint trail leading northeast through the brush.

A vulture circles omniously overhead.

A chipmunk scurries about.

A distant wind blows, echoing over the hills.

The chipmunk turns its gaze dramatically at you;  is that an orchestra playing?  It bolts away, speeding east.

The vulture sails off, heading west.

Bluff
You&apos;re standing on a wide bluff about fifty feet up a small mountain, overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill.  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.

Summit
Here at the top the mountain, the wind blows strong and carries the smell of endless summer.  There are no trees up here, no tall grass, but bits of shrubbery dot the area.  The view is remarkable, though;  you can see grassy hills for miles around.  A train track clearly extends north into the distance, running away from this mountain.

A chipmunk scurries about.

The chipmunk looks at your possessions and freezes in place for a moment.  It bolts away, speeding west.
