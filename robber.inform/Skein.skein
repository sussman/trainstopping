BAM!  A mug of ale hits the table, splashing your shoes.  Muddy Charlie slumps back in his chair, eyes you carefully, and starts to chuckle.

&quot;You know your problem?  You don&apos;t think big enough.&quot;

His expression is familiar.  Last time you saw that look, it was just before you two decided to rustle the mayor&apos;s private herd back in 1866.  That didn&apos;t work so well.

&quot;What now?&quot; you ask.  &quot;A new idea?&quot;

&quot;Big plans.&quot;  He grins widely.  &quot;That new cross-country railroad is almost finished.  It&apos;s gonna change everything... bigger trains, more people... and prize cargo.&quot;

&quot;A train holdup?  Are you kidding?&quot;

&quot;Relax.  This time we got technology on our side.&quot;  He leans close and whispers:  &quot;Made in Sweden... or Germany.  It&apos;s big, dangerous, and nobody knows about it yet.&quot;

&quot;A new weapon?&quot;

&quot;Dynamic, buddy.  Dynamic Might.&quot;

Release 8 / Serial number 070805 / Inform 7 build 4U67 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/11N) SD
(Type HELP if you&apos;re new to interactive fiction.)

Dirt Road
Muddy wasn&apos;t particularly clear in his instructions, but you&apos;re pretty sure this is the trail he wanted you to follow this morning.  Now that your horse has inexplicably bolted, you can use all the luck you can get.

This is a dusty trail that wanders off east and west for miles.  The sun blasts down on the back of your neck, but you can smell the cool tang of some pine trees off to the north.  You also spy the lower slopes of a small mountain that way.

Bluff
You&apos;re standing on the edge of a dangerous, collapsed bluff overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills.  Below you, a train track runs out of a narrow tunnel though the hill. (Of course, the tunnel is now completely full of rocks and dirt.)  On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock formation, and a path wanders southwest through the brush.

You feel a tap on your back, and you spin around.

Three guns are pointed in your face.

&quot;We know all about your plan&quot;, one of Marshalls states coldly.  &quot;We&apos;ve been tracking you and Muddy for days.  Keep your hands in the air, and follow us.&quot;

You can see that Muddy is here, also held at gunpoint and already handcuffed.  You pause for a moment, consider your options, then decide that death is perhaps worse than being locked in a cell with an angry Muddy.

&quot;Don&apos;t worry&quot;, Muddy whispers.  &quot;I have a plan...&quot;

The view is remarkable, though;  you can see grassy hills for miles around.  A train track clearly extends north into the distance, and a small bluff is visible further down the north face.
