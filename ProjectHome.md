This is my first attempt to learn the [Inform 7](http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html) programming language:  a simple "intro" game that was originally entered into the 2007 [IntroComp](http://www.wurb.com/if/award/9) competition.  (You can read more about the results [here](http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/IntroComp_2007).)

To play this game, you'll need an Z-Machine interpreter, such as one from the bottom of [this page](http://www.red-bean.com/sussman/if/shortlist.html).
